    	walk+talk is a lecture performance series initiated by the Austrian choreographer and dancer Philipp Gehmacher in 2008. In walk+talks choreographers are invited to create a solo work that makes the moving and talking run parallel. The topic is the artists’ concepts, the individual understanding of their body-in-motion and the history of their practice.

Over 20 artists have participated in five editions of the project that have taken place in Vienna, Brussels, Stockholm, Reykyavik, Berlin and Poznan so far.

    	"walk marks the time that passes, the time needed by movement to unfurl itself. talk stands for the assertion, announcement or speaking out, as well as for the complexity of voicing the truths that constitutes one, that one embodies, truths that both gain and lose meaning in their being expressed."
(Philipp Gehmacher, excerpt programme note walk+talk, Tanzquartier Wien, March 2008)</p>
    	“walk+talk is a practice and method for doing and sharing in a public context as much as a practice that says something about one's practice. It is sometimes less about description and explanation than about the desire to speak becoming a gesture itself, a gesture of utterance running parallel to the movement. Maybe different forms of speech will appear, and some things will be better left unnamed."
(Philipp Gehmacher, programme note walk+talk, Kaaistudio's Brussels, March 2011)</p>
    	The videos and transcriptions of 35 walk+talks by 25 different choreographers are available on the Belgian website for multi-modal documentation called <a class="newslnk" href="http://oralsite.be/pages/Walk_Talk_Documents"> Oralsite</a></p>
