    	The Love Piece is an invitation to experience the performance as an affective encounter, and vice-versa, the encounter as a performative experience. Deciding that the focus of performance is "giving love" says a lot about our desires for theatre; theatre as a social place, performance as a moment of encounter and change, performance as the production of a reality that could either be understood as real or fictional, but in any case that happens. Tension and dramaturgy are produced through the attempt to stay within this situation for a certain period of time and to deal with our affective production.
</p>The love piece unfolds along a loose score that can be described as: there are as many audience members as performers. As they come in, audience members are each taken by the hand by a performer, who for the duration of the show (about 30 minutes) "give love" to his/her audience. What such a love can be, is the stake of the piece.
Love songs are playing the whole time.
